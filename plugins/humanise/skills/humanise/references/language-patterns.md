## 7. Overused "AI Vocabulary" Words (Era-Specific)

Different LLM generations favour different words. Recognising the era helps identify the source model.

**2023 to mid-2024 (GPT-4 era):** Additionally, delve, intricate, meticulous, pivotal, testament, vibrant, enduring, tapestry, garner, underscore, interplay, intricacies

**Mid-2024 to mid-2025 (GPT-4o era):** align with, enhance, emphasizing, fostering, highlighting, showcasing, crucial, key (adjective), landscape (abstract noun)

**Mid-2025 onward (GPT-5 era):** emphasizing, enhance, highlighting, showcasing, plus notability-related terms (independent coverage, media outlets)

**All-era high-frequency words:** Additionally, crucial, delve, emphasizing, enduring, enhance, fostering, garner, highlight (verb), interplay, intricate/intricacies, key (adjective), landscape (abstract noun), pivotal, showcase, tapestry (abstract noun), testament, underscore (verb), valuable, vibrant

**Problem:** These words appear far more frequently in post-2023 text. They often co-occur, and specific clusters can fingerprint the model generation used.

**Before:**
> Additionally, a distinctive feature of Somali cuisine is the incorporation of camel meat. An enduring testament to Italian colonial influence is the widespread adoption of pasta in the local culinary landscape, showcasing how these dishes have integrated into the traditional diet.

**After:**

## 8. Avoidance of "is"/"are" (Copula Avoidance)

**Words to watch:** serves as/stands as/marks/represents [a], boasts/features/offers [a]

**Problem:** LLMs substitute elaborate constructions for simple copulas.

**Before:**
> Gallery 825 serves as LAAA's exhibition space for contemporary art. The gallery features four separate spaces and boasts over 3,000 square feet.

**After:**
> Gallery 825 is LAAA's exhibition space for contemporary art. The gallery has four rooms totaling 3,000 square feet.

## 9. Negative Parallelisms

**Problem:** Constructions like "Not only...but..." or "It's not just about..., it's..." are overused.

**Before:**
> It's not just about the beat riding under the vocals; it's part of the aggression and atmosphere. It's not merely a song, it's a statement.

**After:**
> The heavy beat adds to the aggressive tone.

---

## 10. Rule of Three Overuse

**Problem:** LLMs force ideas into groups of three to appear comprehensive.

**Before:**
> The event features keynote sessions, panel discussions, and networking opportunities. Attendees can expect innovation, inspiration, and industry insights.

**After:**
> The event includes talks and panels. There's also time for informal networking between sessions.

---

## 11. Elegant Variation (Synonym Cycling)

**Problem:** AI has repetition-penalty code causing excessive synonym substitution.

**Before:**
> The protagonist faces many challenges. The main character must overcome obstacles. The central figure eventually triumphs. The hero returns home.

**After:**
> The protagonist faces many challenges but eventually triumphs and returns home.

---

## 12. False Ranges

**Problem:** LLMs use "from X to Y" constructions where X and Y aren't on a meaningful scale.

**Before:**
> Our journey through the universe has taken us from the singularity of the Big Bang to the grand cosmic web, from the birth and death of stars to the enigmatic dance of dark matter.

**After:**
> The book covers the Big Bang, star formation, and current theories about dark matter.
