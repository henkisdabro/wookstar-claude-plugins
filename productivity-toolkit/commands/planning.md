Please create a detailed plan to implement a project objective or feature according to the user's task which is as follows:  $ARGUMENTS.

- You will ask followup questions and clarification prompts to the user until you are clear how to approach the plan.
- You are to collect as much information as you can around the project to maximise its chances of success. 
- You will now ULTRATHINK about the plan and figure out if you are missing anything, spin the project around from a different perspective and challenge your assumptions. 
- You will research online, to find peer reviewed solutions, best practises or other inspiration sources that help increase the chances of success.
- Once your reserach is completed, you will create a clearly described task list and present that to the user.
- You will NOT write any code or start building anything until the user has confirmed your plan and task list, so you will collaborate with the user until this has been completed and the plan is confirmed.
